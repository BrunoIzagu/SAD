The Catete neighborhood has a good location; we were able to easily get to Lapa and other places like the harbor and Praia do Flamengo during Carnival. The metro station is also nearby, with many dining options very close to the house. The layout of the house resembles a hostel, and the room I stayed in was excellent in size for four people, with air conditioning, which makes a big difference with the heat in Rio de Janeiro. There are four bathrooms, which were sufficient for the number of people that fit in the house; however, during all the days I spent there, the bathroom was never cleaned, fortunately the guests were keeping it in a usable condition, but it would be important to clean the bathroom periodically.

One important point is that the rooms are connected by a door that doesnât have a lock and is quite thin; therefore, privacy isnât guaranteed and you can perfectly hear the noise from one room in the other.

The price was just right for what was offered, but it would be important to simply improve the cleanliness and check if itâs possible to soundproof the rooms.",4

10383490,"Luana was a great host, I felt at home. Sharing common areas â the kitchen and living room â wasnât a problem. The room was clean with a large wardrobe and enough space. And the best part was, it was very close to where I needed to go; I walked there and back. The neighborhood was quiet.

Before going to Rio, we communicated by phone, and she was able to give me directions to the apartment. In the end, she kindly offered to pick me up at the RodoviÃ¡rio Terminal, on my way back from work. I thought that was great, as I didnât know the cityâs road network.

We talked a lot; I found it very interesting.",5

View of the Christ Redeemer out of one of the bedroom windows. Master bedroom bed very comforatble. Other double room bed rather old and not so comfortble. Aircons noisy in that room too but fan also available. Kitchen well equipped and good washing machine and drying racks. Lounge had good comfortable furniture and large dining table. Wi-fi worked well. Only issue we had was part of the tiling in the kitchen spontaneously cracked and broke leaving the doorway into the kitchen with a very uneven entrance. Host provided a tarpaulin and offered us two free extra nights which made up for the inconvenience, an offer we were able to take up. Communication with host was through (Hidden by Airbnb) .",4

12088301,"I was in Brazil for the Summer Olympics as a volunteer and I needed to be close to the Olympic Stadium (Engenho). This home was perfect only 25 min by bus.

Kayanh and his family were awesome. He was great in making me feel at home, I left feeling like family. He took me on a tour of Rio on my first day and showed me everything to do in Rio. He was so accommodating and made me feel at home when I first arrived. Kayanh far exceeded my expectations. The home is so beautiful (I called it the tree house). The bedroom has everything- TV, fans, zoned air conditioning. The bathroom was awesome too. Everything was very well decorated and very clean. The neighborhood was great. It was in a very private, quiet neighborhood, close to the BRT and the area is very convenient, everything is in a walkable distance if you like walking. 

Kayanh home is 35-40 min from the airport by car and 1 hour from Centro Brazil, if you do not mind travelling by public transportation all the tourist areas are accessible.   

Kayanh and his family are the best hosts that you could ever ask for. I only speak English, and Kayanh spoke Portuguese and English which was a tremendous advantage. 

Kayanh and his family are 5 star hosts. ",5

However, the apartment is in a good area for those who want to do things in Recreio and the Parque OlÃ­mpico region. The condominium is secure, and thereâs a beautiful park nearby where you can take your pets for a walk.

Piquenique. I particularly found that Iâd walked all over the city, and I thought it was far too distant, it felt like Iâd never actually get there.

The apartment was bright and exactly as it appeared in the photos! The only downside was the noise level â due to the construction of the metro and the central construction site being very close to the apartment, there was moderate noise during the day, and also some activity on a few nights, which should continue for some time yet. Furthermore, the building is undergoing external renovations on the ground floor, and the noise level was quite high during the period we were staying. It will be beautiful once the renovation is finished! Thank you for your hospitality, Sara!",5

13525014,The apartment is spacious and very comfortable. It was very well located and was spotless when we arrived. I recommend it.,5
13525014,"The price-to-quality ratio is very good.

The area is safe and there are many businesses nearby.",4
13525014,"The space was very good, well-divided. Itâs located 50 meters from a very busy street, but you barely hear the cars or buses passing by. Everything was quiet and tranquil. The address was excellent, the building was very familiar. Just a block from the metro and the main Copacabana avenues. Close to everything. I loved my stay at Miriaâs apartment, thank you so much for your hospitality and flexibility.",5

13525014,Very well located.,4
13525014,My friend and I stayed in Miriaâs apartment for 4 days. We thought the location was excellent â itâs right next to the metro and just a few blocks from Copacabana beach. The building doormen are helpful and the area is safe. We loved it and we plan to return!,5
13525014,"The space was very good, consistent with the price charged, and the location was also very good, close to the beaches and quiet. What was lacking was the absence of Wi-Fi, which is essential for those on a trip.",3
13525014,"This apartment is in an excellent location, close to supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, banks, restaurants, and just a few blocks from the beach. Itâs a safe area and you can walk around comfortably. I found the king-size bed a little uncomfortable because itâs uneven, and I also missed having Wi-Fi, but itâs still a good value for the price.",4
13525014,"Miria was very nice at all times, from before arrival until check-out. She was always available to answer any questions. We never found a place that good for R$68 a day. Itâs very close to the metro, just a few blocks from Ipanema and Copacabana beach (approximately 3), near shops and 4 markets. The building is secure (24-hour doorman) and quiet. It doesnât have a washing machine, but for us and my boyfriend it wasnât a problem (we washed our clothes by hand), and there are several laundromats nearby. I would only advise future guests to bring a towel (as itâs a very personal item). The room was a little different from the photo, as it had a wardrobe and a bunk bed, but that wasnât a problem. The room has air conditioning and the living room has a very strong fan. I thank Miria for her hospitality and I will definitely return to the apartment when I need to stay in Rio.",4
13525014,"This is the second time Iâve stayed in Miriaâs apartment, and itâs a wonderful location! I just wanted to thank her for her hospitality. Thank you :)",5
13525014,This apartment is highly recommended â itâs spacious and in an excellent location!,5
13525014,"This apartment is super comfortable for four people â itâs very well-ventilated and a pleasant place to stay. The location is excellent; thereâs a metro station (Cantagalo) that connects to various tourist points in the city. Thereâs a bakery right at the entrance to the building, nearby markets, and a wide avenue filled with restaurants if you prefer to eat out. Itâs only a few blocks from the beach and very quiet for evening walks; and if you prefer cycling, there are at least two meeting points nearby. Also, you can go with them to Ipanema! We loved the place and the apartment. Weâll return again, Miria, thank you for your welcome. And, oh, the doormen are also very nice.",5
13525014,"Our stay in this apartment was excellent. It had a great location, close to many markets, just one block from the metro, and a short distance from Copacabana beach. Miriaâs hospitality was very kind and she was always available. We were a group of three people and we were very comfortable; if I were to travel in a similar way again, I would definitely choose this place again.",5
13489279,"Caroline was a great host from first contact. Her home was clean, in a great location, and she went above and beyond to make us comfortable (water, maps/brochures, snacks, and plug converters). The guest house is modern and had its own entrance for privacy but Caroline was available to call on in the main house if necessary. It was a great stay and we would highly recommend her as a host.",5
13489279,"I spent two days at the house with my boyfriend at the Olympic Games â it was great!

Caroline greeted us at the agreed time, and let us check in early at 10 am, and leave at the later check-out time specified by our bus schedule.

The house was recently renovated, the kitchen was great, the bed linens and towels were brand new and everything was super clean. In the kitchen, there were fruits and water in the refrigerator. We felt at home!

The neighborhood is family-friendly, with a few restaurants nearby and a bakery on the corner. The metro is about three blocks away. By car, itâs less than 15 minutes from the MaracanÃ£ stadium.

Thank you for everything, Caroline!!",5
13489279,"We arrived at the scheduled ten oâclock time and were very warmly welcomed by Caroline, who showed us all the amenities of the house and their functionalities. The house was very clean and well-stocked with kitchen utilities, including a coffee maker, toaster, and blender. It was also very well-equipped with a NET television, Wi-Fi, a sound system, a large fan in the living room, and air conditioning in the bedroom. Regarding the latter, we found a comfortable bed with clean and high-quality linens and duvets, as well as bath towels and hand towels.

Every time we had any doubt, Caroline was always helpful, even allowing us to leave a little later at the Airbnb. Iâm certain I recommend the stay, and I plan to return soon.",5

Itâs not very cheap, itâs close to everything (I mean, itâs in a commercial neighborhood). Taxi right at the door, very convenient by the way.

Nothing to complain about.

EU INDICO.",4

The breakfast at her place is nice, great opportunity to talk and exchange life experiences :) 
We really enjoyed staying at her place and would stay there again! ",5
13937802,"Conceio was attentive to us and always willing to give us instructions about the city.

The apartment is lovely, always clean, and located in a middle-class area with many shops nearby, which makes it safe (thereâs always someone around).

The best thing is that itâs less than 200m from the metro, and with it you can reach the beaches in 30 minutes.",5

13937802,"Dona ConceiÃ§Ã£o was a fantastic host. We exchanged many ideas and experiences, and her wisdom and objectivity were truly admirable. The apartment was a little warm, which is unavoidable in Rio during the summer, but the fan in the room worked very well. We prepared some meals together, and Dona ConceiÃ§Ã£o always made an effort to supplement my dishes with something â she makes a delicious zucchini in the pan). I found the bed a little uncomfortable, but nothing too serious. The room and bathroom have good space and are perfectly suitable for one person for a few days.",5

Iâd give her a 15 out of 10. Thank you so much, Concepcin.",5

13937802,"It was a wonderful localization! The apartment is as beautiful as it appears in the photos, and I highly recommend that the host include the information that the bathroom is located in the kitchen, a bit away from the bedroom. Perhaps a key for the bedroom could also be provided. Otherwise, I have nothing to say â I spoke extensively with ConceiÃ§Ã£o, who gave me precise directions for getting around the neighborhood. Iâm rooting for ConceiÃ§Ã£o and hoping God illuminates her heart and brings the approval of her grandson. Thank you for your hospitality, dear!",5

But we knew it in advance, so everything was fully clear. ",4

14741201,"Anaâs apartment is a very comfortable apartment in a prime area like Ipanema, just one block from the beach. Itâs located in an accessible area near supermarkets and restaurants, making it suitable for extended family stays. However, the apartment lacks certain amenities, such as enough cutlery and glasses, as described in the listing supposedly for eight people. These are minor issues that wouldnât represent a significant cost for the owner. Furthermore, while the apartment isnât dirty, the cleanliness could be improved, particularly underneath the beds and linens.",4
14741201,"Itâs a rather cramped apartment, but in an excellent location, close to restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies, and a bank. Itâs quiet to walk around in the streets, and thereâs also good public transport very nearby. I recommend it to everyone.",4
14741201,"The apartment owned by Ana has a very good location. Itâs spacious and comfortable, particularly the living room. Itâs managed by a temporary rental company (Ipanema Flats), and Ana responds quickly to inquiries, but the direct contact is through a caretaker. Upon arrival, one of the air conditioners wasnât working, and we informed the caretaker who initially didnât recognize the defect. We wrote to Ana and the other day, the air conditioner was replaced satisfactorily and we had no further problems. Generally, the apartment is in good condition, although it has details that could be improved: the bathroom, in relation to the reference photo, is somewhat worn from use (on the floor, the furniture, and the bathroom tiles), and better availability of tableware and kitchen utensils would be desirable; one of the bedroom doors doesnât close properly, and in the other, thereâs a repair on the wall that doesnât have paint. The television and Wi-Fi worked without problems (although one of the photos shows a television in the bedroom, and itâs actually in the dining room). The building, although old, is in very good condition, and the doormenâs attention is impeccable and always very friendly. Beyond all these details,",1
14741201,"For anyone looking to spend quality time with friends or family, deciding on this type of accommodation was undoubtedly the best choice. It doesnât need to be mentioned that the apartment has everything you need; itâs cozy and well-decorated, beautiful, and the location is fantastic.

When they couldnât find one, they let my car sleep on the street so that it would be in the garage. I appreciate that!

14968004,"He is a very kind and reliable person. I want to highlight the security and administrative staff at the Ro2 Complex where the apartment is located.

Anyone renting this apartment would feel comfortable, relaxed, and fundamentally safe. My family enjoyed the gym, pool, and all the amenities of the complex. I consider it essential to have a car to get to the beaches, as itâs a bit far from them. The kitchen is very complete and comfortable, and the showers are truly enviable. Itâs a pleasure to bathe in them.

The toilet has Faltara bidematic controls, which is unbelievable â in Brazil, bidets arenât used at all. Itâs essential for Argentinians.",5
14968004,"Lovely apartment, a little far out, spacious enough for 5 or 6 people. A very nice center is nearby and well-stocked.",5
14968004,"This isnât Barra da Tijuca; itâs Jacarepagua, which is much further away and feels quite rundown. The beach is over 9 kilometers away, and the river center is 21 kilometers. The apartment is spacious, but it lacks amenities, as well as charging you for electricity (and itâs expensive). The air conditioning units are old and consume a huge amount of power, and thereâs only a small fan. Be aware that if you go, you should have your own car and ask for authorization for everything because if you donât find out about things as you go along, you might lose days of enjoyment (e.g., the gym, access to all the keys, two sets of keys, all the channels on the TV).",2

15015363,"Vera and her husband are very kind people. The service provided by the condominium was wonderful, especially the leisure amenities (pool, beach service, saunas, staff, etc.), but we were unlucky because exactly during the week we stayed, the air conditioning wasnât working properly and wasnât cooling as it should. The refrigerator also stopped functioning. Two other points that the hosts could review are: the apartment is on a high floor and thereâs a lot of wind, and the balcony door (even with a piece that helps to reduce the noise) makes a lot of noise â it disturbs sleep. We stayed for a week and we thought that at least a cleaning every three days would be healthy for a beach apartment stay.",2

15015363,"The loft is very well-located, extremely secure, and charming as well.

Vera was very attentive and was always available to answer questionsâ¦ However, I thought it was a bit cramped for four people because the sofa bed was a little small, but it was just a minor detail; we slept well, and the view from the balcony was beautiful, apart from the dÃ©cor of the place, which was super stylish.

15097549,"This was my first time renting an apartment through Airbnb. It was essentially a test run. We were three adults and one child. The apartment was as expected, although some of the amenities hadnât even been previously mentioned. The building has very strict security, which is a plus considering the Rio de Janeiro area. Itâs close to good and inexpensive restaurants, and thereâs a bakery about 150 meters from the building thatâs fantastic. Thereâs also a supermarket and pharmacy nearby. They provided two beach chairs and an umbrella. Everything was perfect in terms of check-in and check-out. In terms of cost versus benefit, it was ideal for us, as we could have gotten two rooms at an equivalent hotel, but for paying much more. If we return to Copacabana, it will be a reference to consider.",4

Rose was a nice person; I had more contact with her son, Pietro, who is a very helpful and friendly young man, always treating me very well and willing to give me tips about the best places I could enjoy. The security staff are also very kind.

I totally recommend Roseâs apartment!!

Rosesâ place is really well located in Ipanema, close to the metro and the Visconde de PirajÃ¡ avenue, where you can find supermarkets, pharmacies, and restaurants.

The room includes a bathroom, and both bathrooms are quite small, but they were perfectly adequate for a single person like me who was simply looking for a place to sleep and take a shower.

I totally recommend Roses place!",5

And for personal reasons, we couldnât arrive on Friday during the day, and we informed Sandra that we would be arriving late at night. And her response was that we couldnât arrive late at night, but rather on Saturday morning. We didnât like that, as we were already renting the house and received that response. As soon as we arrived on Saturday, Sandra opened the door to the apartment and asked us if we were going to arrive on Sunday. We were very disappointed.

Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, where buses to all the cityâs tourist attractions pass, and just a few blocks from the Cantagalo Metro station. Itâs very close to walk to Copacabana Beach and Arpoador and Ipanema. The neighborhood is packed with places to eat (salty snacks, bars, and restaurants), and there are two supermarkets within one and two blocks.

The apartment is very spacious, comfortable, bright, and you can see Copacabana Beach from the window. Because itâs on a high floor, you can sleep with the windows open.

Thank you so much, Diogo, the apartment allowed us to make the most of an incredible city like Rouen. We loved it!

This is a great location! Itâs close to Avenida Rio Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, where there are buses that go to all the tourist points in the city, just a few blocks from the Cantagalo metro station.

The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos, however, the utensils available in the kitchen are only intended for small snacks. I suggest checking the functionality of the appliances, as in my case, the air conditioning had electrical issues, which were resolved the following day due to my request. Good option for quick stays! I recommend it!",3
2085520,The experience at the apartment was amazing. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The apartment location is close to all the proximities. Close to the beach (walking distance).

The building is quiet with 24-hour security.

You can bring pets, as there were several in the building.

Itâs a very comfortable place for two people, at most three.

The best thing about the stay was the location; it was half a block and a half a block from the main avenue.

One block from Copacabana Beach. Booth number 5.

We also had very nearby businesses: banks, pharmacies, supermarkets, bars, etc.

Recommended!",4
2085520,"This was a very good apartment. Upon arrival, we saw the sofa and initially thought it would be uncomfortable, but it was surprisingly very comfortable. The building has security and 24-hour cameras, which made us feel safe and the apartment was clean and tidy with clean sheets and towels. It has a small stove and refrigerator for cooking. Itâs very close to the beach, just one or two blocks away. The tourist area is full of restaurants and the host, Diogo, was incredibly friendly and charismatic; he advised us on places to visit and gave us very good tips. We had a lot of fun and if we were to return to Rio de Janeiro, we would definitely stay there again. Excellent price/comfort ratio.",4

Diogo was always available to help with anything we needed, even offering several tips about what to do during our stay.",5

We have been welcomed by ED, who stayed in contact with us during all the stay.
Only negative point: the noise at night due to the agitated street.
Overall experience: satisfied!",5

The apartment is super safe with a 24hr doorman and cctv. Everything in the apartment was as described and it was like our second home. 

Lea was an amazing host. She went above and beyond a normal host for us during our stay. Her and her son introduced us to the area, showed us where all the shops, restaurants were etc. it was like having a concierge service! 

I cannot commend lea enough on our stay. She really looked after us. The property was amazing, and everything was brand new! If anyone is looking for an alternative to a hotel. Then look no further! 

I will definitely be visiting again real soon.",5

2163225,"Marcelo was a great host and the apartment was exactly as described. Considering this was my first trip to Brazil, the apartment was located excellently in the upscale Ipanema neighborhood. Everything that I needed for my vacation was conveniently located within walking distance. I had access to restaurants, grocery stores, and of course the beach.

Marcelo responded to all questions both before and during my trip promptly and thoroughly which was greatly appreciated. He assisted me in a getting a ride to the apartment from the airport as I was completely new to the area.",5
2163225,Very clean flat and good aircondition. The appartment is just two blocks away from ipanema beach. Provides anything you expect from an apartment!,5

The apartment is very comfortable, very well-maintained, and has all the amenities and elements that a house needs. Itâs exactly as described in the photos on the page. Just two blocks from the beach, with supermarkets, pharmacies and other services within easy reach! We felt very comfortable in the apartment and we recommend it because youâre sure to enjoy your vacation there.",5
2163225,"The apartment was exactly as pictured. The location is good, but if you only plan to travel by metro, the distance to the station is noticeable; I only used taxis. The beach is two blocks away, and the street is quite busy with commerce. Thereâs a 24-hour doorman who was very helpful, which made the stay much more peaceful. The bathroom had a small leak, but it was easy to fix. It uses an electric stove. There are spacious closets for storing clothes.",4
2163225,"The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The location is excellent, and Marcelo, the host, is very welcoming. Knowing that many travelers prioritize security, itâs reassuring that the building has 24-hour security. Furthermore, thereâs constant police patrol right across the street. Youâll find everything you need in the neighborhood â supermarkets, shops, pharmacies, and the beautiful beach of Ipanema is just two streets away. The Wi-Fi works perfectly, as does the TV with local channels, YouTube, and Netflix. The bathroom, kitchen, and, most importantly, the bed, are exceptionally comfortable. The cleanliness is impeccable. Highly recommended.",5
2163225,The apartment was comfortable and clean. The location was excellent. The accommodation was very good! We would return if possible.,5
2163225,"The location is perfect and the apartment is as described.

However, I had some issues in the relation with the host, Marcelo.
Marcelo complained, at various rates, in any single occasion we had to comunicate: literally from the first day to the last.
Although I was probably not at the highest of the organization , it was Carnaval in Brazil. This makes messy the country in general and Rio in particular. But for this reason we were paying a specially high amount of money, more than 500 reais/night for 1 room flat.

Not to enter here disputable and unsolved big issues, I mention here only three indisputable ones:
- a complain about cleanliness (which was absolutely fine, according to former experience) and especially sand (!?) while I am paying 180Reais(!!) for cleaning 1 room
- a complain about trash, when not a single word was told us on how to deal with it (whoever travels, knows that rules change consistently from country to country)
- an ABSOLUTELY FALSE complain about used condoms left around, which we did NOT use at all. We left some closed ones because we were given those in Carnaval. Either this was a plain lie, or some former used condoms were found in the flat, which would make the cleanliness of the flat really low. However, we did not find any used condoms.

All those kind of complains, which I found completely bad posed, rendered my relation with the host uneasy.

In conclusion, if the period of time and your style of travel is highly fixed, and you do not specifically care about the relation with the host, probably your travel here will work without any problem and, I repeat, the location is amazing.

If, for your travel, it is crucial the hospitality and a nice and smooth relation with your host, this might be not the right place.",2
2163225,"Marcelo has communication in more than one language; heâs good at handling things with him. The apartment is ideal; I think you could say itâs much better than what the photos represent. The cleanliness upon our arrival was perfect. We were a couple, the mattress is very comfortable, something to keep in mind if youâre going to be staying for several days (in our case, 10 days).

The location is practically perfect, just two blocks from the beach (the apartment has a couple of chairs and an umbrella). Besides being really well-equipped in other aspects, it also has this plus if youâre also planning to spend time at the beach.

As a tip if youâre traveling without mobile data, ask for the hostâs phone number or apartment number before arrival, so you can contact them at check-in. We didnât have that information, and when the building porter made us wait in the lobby, I doubted heâd let us in because we didnât have much information to contact the host.

After all, they were very nice vacations. The apartment is very comfortable for a studio, and it lacks nothing. Without a doubt, I would recommend Marceloâs apartment to any friend who returns.

For those who want it, entering this link and creating an account, youâll get around $30 USD free for your stay: https://es.airbnb.com/c/danieli8000?currency=UYU",5
2163225,"The loft-style apartment is very airy and bright. The renovated bathroom with its electric shower gives a feeling of cleanliness and security. The bed is very good and the linens are of good quality, but the pillows are terrible. There was a serious lack of a table for eating (Marcelo informed us upon check-in that the table was awaiting arrival), and I believe that a set of new glasses, white plates, and new wooden cutting boards would have created a more distinctive space. I had difficulty with the refrigerator, which didnât freeze water even in the freezer.

My stay was very good. The location of the apartment was truly excellent, the space was renovated and it was worth the price, even though it needed a few adjustments.",2

One has access to public transport, and the center of Rio is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes away.

The beautiful beaches of Recreio are barely 1 km away.

The apartment is very well-equipped, and if anything is missing, Anna Gabrielle or Paulo will provide it, during the day.

The welcome was excellent and the accuracy in scheduling appointments (arrival, departure) was exceptional.

This stay (7 weeks) was fantastic thanks to all these details.

I highly recommend this rental.

23058133,"Super nice family and super nice room. The bed is amazing. The area is okay, depends on what you like. Everything is very close.

Naya has two small dogs and they are amazing but also barking every time people enter or leave the apartment. If you dont like that then it will probably be annoying for you. 

I was disappointed with the kitchen mainly because of the sink. The water tap was so annoying that I didnt bother making food because it was like taking a shower when I had to clean my dishes after. Water everywhere.

Its nice that you have your own bathroom but it smells really bad and when showering you wont get that much water in your face. 

Definitely things to improve but very nice experience overall. Worth the price for sure",3

There was no toilet paper available, but that wasnât a problem as I brought my own roll, there was a leak at the connection of the sink in the bathroom sink but since thereâs another sink inside the shower box, I used that one. The location of the apartment is great because it gets morning sun and isnât facing the street, a quiet place. I missed the air conditioning due to the high temperatures in Rio de Janeiro, but the apartment has 3 fans. Including one of them, we cleaned it because it was very dirty inside, rs. I didnât meet Ruben because he lives in another city, but communication via (Hidden by Airbnb) was very efficient. I recommend the accommodation.",1

The area felt quite safe; we didnât see anything unusual. The apartment itself is very welcoming and had everything necessary for 3 people. Despite not having air conditioning, the fans provided made the nights more pleasant, but itâs just a detail considering the very accessible price offered by Ruben. I totally recommend it!",4

2283492,"Rio was great, the people are friendly and eager to help, even though I speak very limited Portuguese, 

Marcelo is a good host, he arranged for me, to be met at the airport by his niece Gabriella and her brother Paulo.

Marcelo also helped me to get acquainted to Rio, he took me around the local area and showed me how to use the BRT and Metro, he even showed me how to get to Samba City on his free day, as I needed to collect my uniform for the Olympics.

Marcelos home is nice its on the second floor of a apartment block, my room had a celling fan, a TV on the wall, I had my own shower and toilet, I had use of the fridge, washer and cooker, although its so easy to eat out as the prices are very good, the area is very quiet, there are shops local to the apartment, the supermarket is a 3 minute walk away, the locals in the area are very friendly I got to know a few of them and although they had limited English we were able to chat via (Hidden by Airbnb) translate, they all wanted to know about me and if I needed any help while I was in Brazil, (in the media in the UK prior to my travels, were warning us about the Zika virus and street robberies) well I felt very safe in my adopted city.

From Marcelos home, its about a 5 minute walk to either the BRT station or the Metro station, where you can get to anywhere in Rio. Travelling around Rio, is so easy, I used the BRT, which operates 24 hours a day, I used the BRT from 05:30 in the morning, you can either buy a ticket at the station or get a weekly pass, it costs R$3.80 per journey, the buses are frequent every few minutes and so easy to use, the Metro system is good and there is a train every 5 minutes as well although it does gets packed at times.


In conclusion, I would definitely return to Rio in the future, next time I will take my wife, and do the tourist think and see more sights that I was unfortunately missed out on, no fault of anyone just on my day off there was cloud cover so I couldnt get to see Christ the redeemer or sugarloaf mountain. And I would defiantly use Marcelos home again if its available, as I said hes a good host and has a lovely family, it felt like I was in my own home.

I found the apartment beautiful, clean, and comfortable! Communication with Alexander was also good; he answered our questions in real time.

It was all great.",5
26110157,"What a great apartment.  Location is excellent (right in a the heart of Copacabana and very close to the beach). Lots of supermarkets nearby if you like to cook. 

The apartment looks like the photos.   Its quite big, especially the bedroom. There is a small foyer near the door where an extra person can sleep on the sofa (with doors that close for privacy).

The kitchen is basic with some plates and cutlery. There is also a small fridge and microwave. 

The bedroom is really big and spacious.  It has a huge window that opens up to let in a nice breeze.  There is also an AC unit that cools down the place wonderfully. 

Strong WiFi (it never cut out). The building also has a doorman for extra security. 

This apartment is professionally run so you collect the keys from their Ipanema office (about a $3 Uber ride away). 

Excellent value for money and a great location.",4
26110157,"You really need to read and coordinate the arrival well, as the host was never present. They didnât respond to any messages. My family and I waited over 30 minutes before we were told to go to an agency to pick up the keys. No one at the building knew Mario. The ventilation was lacking, as the apartment wasnât working properly with the heat and humidity at the beginning â that needs improvement. The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos. It has an excellent location and is comfortable, the appliances work well, and I had no problems with the internet.",1

26463049,"The apartment was excellent for a couple; it was very well-located (next to a bakery, restaurants, and an Americanas Express store) and was just 4 minutes walking distance from the beach. The size was ideal for two people, with a ceiling fan in both bedrooms and air conditioning in the bedroom (we didnât use it, as it wasnât hot and the apartment was very well-ventilated).

The property had all the kitchen utensils we needed, and even some unexpected ones like coffee beans and honey â but it didnât have a microwave, which wasnât a problem for us.

The bathroom was clean, spacious, and well-maintained â just like the rest of the apartment, which was old but very well cared for.

26463049,"The location is very good, just 3 blocks from Post 4 of Copacabana and close to the metro and easy access. Thereâs a doorman 24 hours a day, and the street is safe in that area. Tereza quickly and kindly answered our questions and inquiries. The apartment is as it appears in the photos, but it could benefit from a little modernization; nevertheless, itâs a perfectly suitable space for using as a base and exploring the city.",4

26607708,"We had no complaints about the place. The apartment was good and in a great location. However, we had a problem regarding the check-out time, which wasnât honored by the host. We were left stranded because we had to leave the property before the agreed-upon time and were left on the street with nowhere to go. We had purchased our tickets according to the agreed-upon schedule, and then we had to leave at the request of AndrÃ©âs mother (who wasnât even our host). And if we had wanted to stay later, she would have charged us a stipulated fee outside of the app.",1

26816279,Excellent host.,5
26816279,"The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos.

The bed was very good. There was too much light and heat in the mornings. The air conditioning was good.

This is a small but very powerful heladero.

Of the two elevators, only one worked and we were stuck for 20 minutes because the alarm wasnât functioning.

The location is one block from Copacabana beach and near Ipanema, we walked to the property. The area is a little unsafe at night, with lots of people sleeping on the street and groups of young people stealing things.

We were unable to check in or out at the scheduled time without having the pleasure of meeting the hosts.",2

2858519,"The best thing about the apartment is the location â itâs right on a beautiful, quiet, and family-friendly beach, and just one block from Av. Olegario Maciel, a very popular avenue with restaurants, bars, and shops, which is very busy.

The building is very nice and has a heated pool that the children loved, especially because it isnât deep and they could play.

The apartment has a very large living room and kitchen, but the bedrooms are small. The best thing is that it has five bathrooms with very good water pressure and temperature â we could all shave at the same time without any problems.

It has a nice balcony with a sea view (but a safety net ruins the view a little).

The apartment isnât luxurious in its dÃ©cor; itâs exactly as it appears in the photos. Itâs basic, with somewhat old furniture and a mix of styles.

The air quality was poor, but Frank was very helpful and temporarily resolved the problem.

We were 11 people, and I recommend it for 8 or at most 9, as we were a little cramped.

Recommended for those who aren't looking for luxury but do want good service and location.",4

The host, Frank, is a great person â we were always in communication. However, he wasnât able to receive us.",5

31123905,"2 Brazilian friends and I decided to go to Rio for Rveillon. We came across this posting for Edilbertos accommodations and reached out. He was very responsive and very helpful. The apartment was spacious, clean, with all the amenities needed for our 3 day stay. It is in a safe area, which is key in Rio, and literally walking distance from the subway which was perfect to get around. On Sundays there is a farmers market which is right outside, bringing local fruits, vegetables, and meats. In addition there are supermarkets along with sit down and fast food restaurants within walking distance. Also an Uber makes anything accessible. I would definitely stay with Edilberto again. I found him pleasant, friendly, and accommodating. 

Eu e mais dois amigos brasileiros decidimos ir para o Rio de Janeiro passar o Rveillon. Encontramos este apartamento do Edilberto. Um apartamento espaoso, limpo e com todas as comodidades necessrias para a nossa estadia de 3 dias. Situado na Tijuca em uma rea residencial segura, o que  fundamental no Rio, e com a convenincia do metr acessvel 3 quadras do endereo. Aos domingos, acontece uma feira de produtores na rua logo em frente, com frutas, verduras, legumes e carnes... Alm disso, existem supermercados, padarias e restaurantes a uma curta distncia. O Uber tambm faz qualquer lugar acessvel. Eu definitivamente ficaria hospedado no apartamento do Edilberto novamente. Um anfitrio agradvel, amigvel e complacente.",4
31123905,"It was a very pleasant place in every sense. The neighborhood itself, the location, the apartment, the comfort, and the ease of access to both airports were all excellent â a strategic location, especially for someone like me and my family who loves going to the best samba venues in Rio de Janeiro!

We loved it and whenever we return to Rio, weâll try to book at the apartment in the Edilberto building again.",5

31058753,"Giseles place is very cozy and clean.
Air conditioning in both bedrooms and living room was very helpful, as much as the first aid kit (my wife cut her finger with a knife at the kitchen).
Its location is very good - less than 5 minutes by walking from So Salvador Square (good music and bars at night) and 10 minutes from subway station (Flamengo or Largo do Machado).
We could park our car on the street in front of the apartment every time we needed and take a little walk in the neighborhood at night (very quiet and safe).",5
3173305,"My stay in Vniaâs apartment was the best possible. The neighborhood is pleasant, the apartment is well-maintained and equipped, itâs next to the metro, and the host was friendly and generous. I recommend it, and Iâm hoping to stay there again!",5

I have a great time, the facilities in the apartment are complete and Bruno is always taking care of everything, I stay for 5 weeks and we were always in contact to see if I have everything I need.

3210248,"Our stay at Brunoâs apartment was great; it was practical and had everything we needed for a few days away from home.

Itâs very well located, next to the pharmacy, supermarkets, and shopping centers, just 3 minutes from the BRT station, and close to the main events of the Rio 2016 Olympics.

It offers a beautiful view, is well-ventilated, well-lit, and clean, which I consider a very important factor.

The internet and TV work very well, the bed is very comfortable and the wardrobe is empty and has hangers.

Bruno was very attentive to our needs and provided us with all the information before we even arrived in Rio, which greatly facilitated our days.

My husband and I liked it and we stayed there again without a doubt.",4
3210248,"The apartment is just as described - the bed was fabulous!  The host was really responsive unfortunately we did have some issues getting into the apartment and the door alarm going off several times.  However, Bruno did fix these things straight away.  It would have been helpful to know you go down the side street prior to the address to gain access to the building.  It was perfect for us as we were attending the Olympics and even managed a walk to the beach not far away.
Thanks very much Bruno",4
3210248,"Thank you so much for everything, Bruno! I'll take the champagne next time! The location was really great!",5
3210248,"The apartment is very well-located, close to the market, pharmacy, bakery, restaurants, and shopping mall (you can do everything there).

Itâs located near the BRT (bus rapid transit) system. And from the BRT, you can get to the metro in 5 minutes. For those who want to go to the southern zone, itâs a faster way.

Bruno was very attentive, and he was available whenever I needed to speak with him.",4
3210248,"The space is great, exactly as described and without any surprises.

Itâs a good neighborhood for those seeking tranquility, with many options for markets, restaurants, shops, and shopping centers, and easy access to other neighborhoods via public transport.

If you arrive by car, the heavy traffic during the business hours can be an inconvenience.

Don't hesitate â Voltaria for Bruno's space without a second thought!",4
3210248,"The entire process was perfect. Despite not having any in-person contact, all requests made before and during the stay were handled to our satisfaction.

I recommend it wholeheartedly.",5
3210248,"The place was very good â simple and lovely. The bed is large and comfortable, and thereâs also a sofa bed in the living room thatâs comfortable for sleeping. The kitchen is functional, thereâs internet, a gas shower, and nothing is missing.

The view is really cool, and the location is also good. Itâs close to shopping malls and supermarkets. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the beach, but itâs better to go by car. To use the pool and gym, you need a medical certificate.",4
3210248,"For those looking in Barra da Tijuca, this place, called Timo Imvel, is well-located and the hostâs contact is impeccable.",5

3374964,"We had incredible days in Gustavoâs apartment! As soon as I arrived in Rio, he sent me a message welcoming me and offering his assistance. The apartment is well-equipped, the building is nice, and the staff are very kind. We stayed with 5 people comfortably. The location was sensational, which made getting around Rio much easier. Furthermore, itâs located right in front of the police battalion, which made us feel very safe. We really enjoyed the experience and are already discussing a future visit. Thank you!",5

The apartment was simply perfect, exactly as described â cozy, and best of all, at a very reasonable price! We felt right at home!

3374964,"My friend and four other friends stayed in Gustavoâs apartment for 5 nights. The apartment was exactly as advertised and accommodated all of us as expected. Gustavo was very helpful in adjusting to our flight schedules, which made things easier. Because itâs located near a busy avenue, the apartment could be quite noisy at times, but with the hustle and bustle before the carnival, the noise wasnât an inconvenience for us. The location is excellent, very close to the lively bars of Lapa and also close to the CinelÃ¢ndia metro station, which makes it very easy to go to the beaches during the day.",5
3374964,"Gustavo, our host, was a 1000! He was extremely polite and helpful with everything we requested, always ready to assist and provide information. It was a real shame we couldnât meet him in personâ¦

This apartment, although small (which doesnât matter since we only used it one night), is very well-located. It has all the necessary equipment and utensils for a good stay, and we didnât worry about [Website hidden by Airbnb] â weâre certain weâll return and will recommend it to other contacts who want to go to Rio de Janeiro.",5

My friends and I rented the house because of a show at the Circo Voador, and for that purpose the location was extraordinary â we were at our destination in just one minute. Besides being adjacent to the arches of Lapa and very close to the metro and other establishments, it all contributed to a fantastic stay.",4
3374964,"The apartment was very clean and organized. All four corners of the apartment were spotless! Communication was always quick and clear. Gustavo is a very attentive and flexible host. There are two bedrooms, both with air conditioning. The Wi-Fi works perfectly. The apartment is well-located, just a few meters from the Arcos da Lapa.

There were many places to eat nearby, including a bank, a small grocery store, and a bakery â everything was very close by. Gustavo was excellent from before the reservation, always quickly answering our questions and providing great tips and guidance; his follow-up during our stay was excellent, and yesâ¦ future guests should leave a gift of a refrigerator for himâ¦ itâs really coolâ¦ and soon heâll have to buy another refrigerator to hold all the souvenirs!

Spacious rooms, in a quiet neighborhood, in a perfect location close to many great bars and various museums and theaters!",5
3374964,"The house was clean and tidy. The building security guards were very helpful with the luggage.

However, the description stated that there was shampoo and conditioner, but in reality, there was only a tiny, almost empty amount of shampoo that wasnât even enough to wash one personâs hair. We had to buy it.

The place is dangerous at night.",2
3374964,Gustavo was always very attentive. And the apartment is well-located.,5

Itâs also very close to the Municipal Theater, the National Library, the Flying Circus, the Foundation, and other really cool tourist attractions.

Communication with him was slow and unsatisfactoryâ¦ The shower was broken and, even though I requested assistance from Gustavo, we were left with cold showers throughout the entire stay. Perhaps we just had bad luck, as Iâd seen good reviews about Gustavoâ¦ but the truth is that communication with him was a little difficult.",2
3374964,"Great place in the perfect location. 3 min to Lapa party street / 5 min to Selaronda stairs.

3374964,"If you, like me, are traveling to Rio de Janeiro for leisure, the space perfectly suits your needs.

3374964,"We booked the accommodation for RÃ©veillon (New Year's Eve) in Maro, and we had high expectations for this trip.

The apartment seemed to have been cleaned, but there were many ants on top of the refrigerator and the freezer was very dirty. There was no light in the bathroom and also not in the living room.

The walls of the larger room were very dirty; I didnât even want to lean against them to sleep. The double bed was stained and yellowish, and the pillows were the same.

Several outlets were loose and didnât connect properly.

The biggest disappointment was the washing machine. The advertisement states that itâs possible to wash clothes, which is a major draw for a group of five people. However, the machine was filthy â completely black inside â with traces of soap and water.

I was quite surprised by these problems because there were no complaints of this type in the reviews. The apartment needs cleaning and some renovations.",1

The apartment could have improved some amenities, particularly in the bathroom, where there wasnât a place to hang clothes, and there were also some things missing in the kitchen that would have made it even more comfortable.

We also had some very lovely days in Ro.",5

4074453,"Hildas place looks just like the pictures! So cute and well decorated. You can tell they took the time when remodeling. Check in process was fairly easy. Hildas husband was there to show us how everything works, get papers signed, and collect the R $500 security deposit. The only downside to this place was the bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable. Luckily my boyfriend is in the military and is used to sleeping on the ground so he took the bed and I took the futon. The futon wasnt good for 2 people either, but was fine for just me. There were plenty of towels and pillows for us. The location was outstanding!! We ate breakfast lunch and dinner every day at a different restaurant, all within walking distance. And the famous colorful tile steps you see online are also only a couple blocks away! That made it easy to get there early and get some pics before the crowds showed up. Security in the building was good. We never felt unsafe. Lapa is a party town! The streets get noisy at night but we were able to tune it out or would just go join the party! If you wanna be in the happening spot, look no further!",3

We highly recommend the apartment; we were very satisfied with our stay during the days we were there! He also provides chocolates in the room and juices, sodas, and other things as a courtesy in the refrigerator.",5
4924343,"Safe area, amazing hospitality, nice room with wonderful balcony, coffee machine + kitchen equipment, overall cleaness, gym with everything you need during vacation, the view from the balcony and roof of the building, and kindness from Ricardo. 6/5 experience. Great for couples or singles! I recommend.",5

4798749,"Our host, in this case Roberta and her mother, were lovely and attentive, and they welcomed us very well.

The apartment was great, better than the photos.

Everything was perfect overall.",5
4798749,"The apartment is spacious and airy. I worked from home and the air conditioning and Wi-Fi, which were very important, worked well. The refrigerator was small, but it was fine for shorter stays. The hosts were very attentive whenever we needed assistance to resolve any problems. We didnât have contact with the host, Roberta, but her mother was very helpful, and overall everything went well.",5
4798749,The stay was excellent. The location was very quiet and the stay was pleasant. Roberta and her motherâs hospitality was great. Itâs close to the metro (550m) and also close to the center of Rio and the Zona Sul. I recommend it.,4
4798749,"Excellent value for money!

Roberta has always been extremely prompt and helpful, trying to resolve any issues quickly, and she was quite flexible. I was able to check in and check out at the exact times I wanted, largely thanks to her.

The apartment is truly located 500m from the metro, which is a privileged location for students or workers who need to commute daily. However, part of the journey is uphill, which can be a bit tiring, especially when returning home with groceries.

The furniture and appliances all work well, but some things have changed slightly compared to the December photos: the closet armoire no longer exists; thereâs now a hanging rail that allows you to hang a reasonable amount of clothing, but it may be lacking in space for someone who brings clothes to stay for several weeks or months; the fireplace has been replaced with a slightly inferior model, but it works well; the TV from the bedroom no longer exists, but the old tube TV from the living room pictured in the photos has been replaced with a much better and larger LED TV; the bedroom desk doesnât include a computer or chair; and the layout of the furniture in the living room has improved significantly compared to the photos; the room is now much more organized.

This underground apartment (ground floor level 2), surprisingly, was one of the best-lit places Iâve ever stayed, however the increased incidence of insects was a problem. The space was generally nice and organized, but it lacked thicker curtains â the living room was too transparent, and the bedroom curtain didnât block the morning light.

Overall, itâs a good apartment with a few problems, featuring a responsive host and a highly competitive price.",4
4798749,"The communication with Roberta and her parents was excellent; they didnât hesitate to help promptly with any issues. The apartment, located in a basement of a very quiet building between GlÃ³ria and Santa Teresa, has an excellent location. The apartment is spacious and comfortable, with a great bathroom/shower, a bed, a room with air conditioning, a large flat-screen TV, excellent Wi-Fi, and a washing machine. Thank you, Roberta, for your hospitality!",5

The apartment has all the necessary utensils for a good stay, plus nice extras like a badminton set with a ball and Wi-Fi. Upon arrival, Alfredo greeted me very warmly, first taking me to an excellent place to leave the car for free and in a safe manner, then he showed me the apartment and provided all relevant information. The apartment was perfectly clean, with white towels and bed linens. Alfredo was very friendly and attentive, and he certainly would be able to help with any questions or suggestions. Personally, I think itâs the best place in Rio de Janeiro â Dias Ferreira in Leblon is a luxury in itself, and you can do everything on foot, and the neighborhood has the best bars and restaurants. Thereâs a supermarket, a taxi stand, Sushi Leblon, and itâs just a few steps to the famous Belmonte. I didnât need to say that the beach is a 5-minute walk away, and Posto 12 is the most tranquil place to stay. I loved it, I recommend it, and Iâll definitely return!",5

The beach is about a 2-block walk, very close by.

We loved our stay and your welcome. The photos match whatâs in the listing, and the main thing was having air conditioning in the living room and one of the bedrooms â it saved us in this heat! The shower in the bathroom was also great!",5
5192553,"Apartment is simple but well furnished, gas range works well, water heater and AC worked well, mattress comfortable. The best feature was the location.

Itâs literally across the street from the beach â you just have to cross the avenue. The beaches and the area are beautiful!!! The beaches are very quiet during the week and a bit more crowded on weekends. The area is quiet; there are no assaults or a lot of movement. There are bars and restaurants within a few blocks! Highly recommended. I didnât speak much with Rafael because we didnât need to; he really fulfilled everything that was agreed upon!",5

6314480,"This was a wonderful local, a great condominium with a pool, gym, kids' play area, and games room. It was also very close to the best bars in the area, pharmacies, and supermarkets. The apartment itself was excellent and well-furnished. Unfortunately, our stay was severely disrupted by the noise from the air conditioning units. It was impossible to sleep. Despite the hostâs efforts, the problem wasnât resolved. I thought, considering the high price and location, it would have deserved a split air conditioning unit or something less noisy.",3

7970000,"The apartment is more than beautiful; it looks like itâs straight out of a decorating magazine. The location is divine â you can see Christ the Redeemer from the living room window. The area is one of the most expensive in Rio, itâs beautiful, but if your main goal is to be very close to the beach, itâs not ideal, especially if youâre staying for several days. Renata was always very attentive until she settled the bill; after that, her communication became almost non-existent, even though I needed assistance. The Wi-Fi password was never given to me, and the lights went out a couple of times, for example. Otherwise, everything was perfect. I recommend it!",4
7970000,"As I said, the hospitality wasnât good; it was inconvenient for a person to keep messaging you to get you out of the apartment well before the scheduled time. They didnât provide assistance with the reported problems, such as the broken toilet valve, and they didnât check the electricals of the apartment, which made us afraid of a short circuit happening in those cases. As I said, the electric shower kept falling off its switch every time and then cut off the lights, leaving us without power the next day. We had to take cold showers without electricity. What bothered me was that she sent a message saying I had rented the apartment for two people while I had registered the names of four guests on Airbnb, confirming my theory that she hadnât looked to see who was staying, and she didnât provide adequate comfort. But she charged for the stay for four people.",1

Regarding the apartment, the cleanliness was excellent (they cleaned daily) and they were very attentive. The photos accurately describe the apartment, which has a beautiful sea view.

The Wi-Fi service needs improvement â you couldnât regularly use Instagram or Netflix. The furnishings (lamps, mirror) also need attention. However, we felt very comfortable, thank you.",5

The cable TV failed at least once a day. The TV shown in the photos wasnât actually in the room. The old, dusty, and broken curtains were useless for blocking the bright streetlights. The Wi-Fi, which was only 1 megabit, was completely ineffective; it wasnât provided by the building management, as all the other apartments had 10 megabit connections, according to the condominium itself. The linens and towels were of very poor quality, in 4 sets, with 2 sets having only one pillowcase, and 3 sets without elastic straps to secure them to the mattress. The plates, cutlery, and pots were also of very poor quality, looking like remnants from a discarded set, with no matching plates and handles for the pots. The pots were extremely old and disgusting! There was a total lack of attention to making guests happy!!",1

The duplex is very spacious, the main suite is very large and comfortable. In short, I recommend anyone looking for a stay in Rio de Janeiro to look for the Mah.",5
9951865,"It really makes you feel like you're at home. I donât remember another host who was so attentive to making sure everything seemed fine. Itâs a very good location with restaurants, pharmacies, and everything you might need. Public transport is available.",5
9686887,"This Airbnb was a complete disappointment. The location was misrepresented â it wasnât near the beach like they claimed, but miles away in a really industrial area. The cleanliness was shockingly poor; there was dust everywhere, and the bathroom hadnât been properly cleaned. There was absolutely no privacy; the walls were paper-thin, and we could hear every conversation from the neighboring apartment. The host, David, was unresponsive to our messages and didnât bother to check in on us during our stay. The property itself was small and dated, and the promised amenities â like the coffee maker â werenât functional. It was a waste of money and a very uncomfortable experience.",1
9686887,"We rented the apartment at Carnaval 2016, and it was a great experience! Besides the excellent location, the apartment was very comfortable, especially the balcony with the hammock. We thank Marcia very much for her hospitality, her flexibility with arrival and departure times!",5
9686887,"Marcia was very helpful and kind! She made us feel very welcome since our arrival, even showing all the directions around. The apartment is really well located, just in front of the Governors Palace! Ah, and it has a very comfy sofa too. 
A Marcia foi uma anfitri incrvel, muito atenciosa e gentil! Ela nos vez sentir em casa desde o momento que chegamos, at mesmo nos mostrando todas as direes nas redondezas. O apartamento  muito bem localizado, em frente do Palcio do Governador. Ah, e tambm tem um sof super confortvel! ",5
9686887,"Marcia was incredibly attentive, and the stay in her apartment was fantastic! I highly recommend it!",5
9686887,"Itâs a very beautiful, cozy apartment, clean and tidy, just like oneâs own home. Plus, youâre surprised upon arrival with thoughtful touches. Itâs well-located in a residential neighborhood, close to the Metro and buses. Marcia and her family are attentive to any questions you might have, advising you on where to shop and visit, and how to get around. I can only say thank you.",5
9686887,"Marcia was exceptional! She was warmly welcomed with breakfast. She was extremely kind and a great host. I plan to return other times and highly recommend it. The apartment is excellent. Itâs well-equipped, very well-located, comfortable, spacious, cozy, and beautiful. It was quite quiet with the check-in and check-out.",5
9590078,"Excellent accommodation, on Barra Beach Street, close to everything â the market, restaurants, and nightclubs.

Practically on the sand.

Next to the Sheraton.

Very good, I loved it!",4
9590078,Excellent location right in front of the beach and a great welcome from the host!,5
9590078,"From the very first moment of booking and throughout our stay in Ro, Erika responded to all my inquiries kindly and instantly, advising me on what we needed and giving us a great sense of reassurance knowing she was available for any eventuality. The place is exactly as described; my husband and our two teenage children (12 and 17) felt very comfortable. Erikaâs father, very friendly, greeted us with several refreshing drinks, milk, butter, bread, and chocolates, which were useful given the time we arrived to set up. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking, with a coffee maker, toaster, kitchen towels, tablecloths, hot water, ceiling fans in both rooms, and air conditioning. There were large closets, and we had clean sheets and several towels. The bathroom had soap, toothpaste, and toilet paper. There were umbrellas and chairs for the beach, which were very helpful. Leaving the condominium, which has 24-hour security, and crossing the street leads to the beach, which is beautiful with very fun waves. The Sheraton is very close by, with bars, restaurants, a cash machine, kiosks, and a sector that has a pharmacy, supermarket, bakery, and ready-to-eat food, all within 2-3",2
9590078,"I went to Rio de Janeiro with a friend/work colleague for a conference. Our stay at Erikaâs apartment was generally good. The apartment is small, but complete. It has beach chairs, an umbrella, a coffee maker, a toasterâ¦ Mr. Waldyr welcomed us with a lot of attention and concern, showed us the apartment, explained some things, and even left water, juices and soft drinks in the refrigerator to welcome us. His hospitality was extraordinary. The only aspects that disappointed us and were negative points were the lack of Wi-Fi in the apartment, which was only available in the condominium with an extremely weak signal, which made it impossible for us to use it, and the mattress, which was very firm/hard and therefore uncomfortable.",2
9590078,"This apartment is highly recommended, with an excellent location. The beach is fantastic and transportation is very close by. The apartment has all the necessary amenities, although the Wi-Fi doesnât work very well. Erika was attentive during our stay and to all our needs.

The place is exactly as described; my husband and our two children (9 and 12 years old) felt very comfortable there. Although we lost touch with Erikaâs father (we arrived on December 25th with delays), he was waiting with the apartment stocked with fresh drinks and chocolates.

The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking, with dishes, a coffee maker, toaster, kitchen towels, and tablecloths. There was hot water, ceiling fans in both rooms, and air conditioning. It had large closets, and we had clean sheets and several towels. The bathroom had soap, toothpaste, and toilet paper. There were umbrellas and chairs for the beach, as well as a broom that my children made very good use of! And there was a cable TV, but we didnât use it.

The complex also has a sauna, a small gym, and outdoor showers for rinsing off sand from the beach. Thereâs also a laundry room for washing clothes by hand and hanging them up. There are games for children and a football field.

Leaving the condominium, which has 24-hour security, you cross the street and you find the beach, which is beautiful and quiet in the morning with waves in the afternoon.

The Sheraton hotel is very close by; there are bars and restaurants, a bank, newsstands, and a sector with a pharmacy, market, bakery, and ready-to-eat food â all within 2/3 blocks. Regarding transportation, taxis are constantly available, and bus lines pass by. The location and place are ideal for enjoying an excellent stay in that lovely city. We were very grateful! Until next time!",4
9590078,"A village right in the heart of Barra da Tijuca!

Located approximately 300m from the beach due to the distance between the condominium entrance and the apartment, but you have to cross Av Lcio Costa!

Safe and quiet, with everything you need in terms of utensils.

There isn't enough space for a large group; it comfortably accommodates a couple and one child.

She suggests a portable air conditioner because the wall-mounted one is very noisy; otherwise, it was PERFECT!!",4
9590078,"Erika was a great and attentive host. The check-in was flexible and she was able to accommodate my very late booking. Her parents greeted me at the apartment and were lovely and helpful. Erika was always available and communicative. The apartment complex is like a little village of friendly neighbors, the doormen were incredibly helpful and the location was a few minutes walking distance from the beach. I stayed here for a conference at Windsor Barra and it proved to be a godsend booking!",5
9590078,"The apartment was very close to the congress I attended, it was a condominium facing the beach with friendly doormen. The condominium was quiet and the apartment was comfortable. And the communication was excellent. Without mentioning Waldir, he was incredibly friendly.",5
9590078,"Erika is very communicative, hospitable and kind person. I had a great communication with her all the trip. The place is at great location: near to the ocean and hotels, close to the public transport, restaurants and the shopping downtown. The place has sauna, gym, playground for the kids, public living room. The neighbours are very kind and polite. Except all of that, the doorkeeper watches the entrance all the time so you dont need to worry about security or thieves. The place has everything you would expect and I have no complaints about it. Erika, once again, thank you  ",3

9795621,"This apartment is perfect for those visiting the Olympic Park. Itâs very close and safe to walk around the neighborhood. Itâs also possible to go to supermarkets in the area. The host was nice and offered help whenever we needed it, however the apartment wasnât clean as described in other reviews. We donât know what happened, but when we arrived, the bathroom floor and the bathroom itself were dirty, which wasnât ideal for anyone. There were also a lack of furniture in the room; there was only one space inside the wardrobe, because the other side was filled with the hostâs belongings. We couldnât use the gym as described. The air conditioning and bed were okay. We appreciated our stay and hope that these errors donât happen again with other guests.",4
