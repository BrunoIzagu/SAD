He was also very responsive to additional questions. The residence service at the counter was also good and the blokes were helpful. The apartment is clean and spacious, although it could do with a couple of extra basic necessities particularly in the kitchen. 

However, two main things made this experience rather average instead of great.
- I reserved a flat with TWO bedrooms and only got one. I complained and they relocated me to a bigger apartment with two separate beds, but still ONE bedroom.  Upon booking make sure to confirm its two bedrooms you sign up to.

- Saturday seemed to be national construction day which meant 8am rise and shine. sunday there was activity too although less loud. Normally not a problem but not great when you experienced some of the Istanbul night life the night before. A notice about this at least would have been great.",2
10115921,"The location is just perfect. You can find everything in the neighborhood such as restaurants, supermarket, exchange, shops....etc.
The lobby of the hotel is small.
I stayed in the two bedroom apt.
Unfortunately, the second room has the bathroom while the master bedroom has none. You have to use the one in the living room.
Some of the staff in the Hotel are very very helpful like Mustafa and some are friendly like Mohamed.",3

Ramazan family has a restaurant, close to apartment, in my opinion is one of the best for taste and price, Thanks to Mr Osman, owner and chef who cook for my family a delicious testi kebap and tuzda balik.

25241699,"Fatih is one of the best hosts that Ive met! Hes not just renting you a room, he shares his home with his guests and does this with all his heart. On the first day he made an amazing dinner for us, taught me how to make Turkish tea and coffee, and told a lot of interesting things about Turkey that only local man knows. He also made a list of best places in Istanbul that are not crowded with tourists and where you can feel real Istanbul life (has anyone ever done this for you?!) The apartment is located in really quite and friendly area, no tourists, real local experience and good transportation options to go anywhere. The room is nice and clean and has amazing view to the city and Bosphorus. So if you want to escape noisy and crowded touristic places and get to know real Turkish life and hospitality, you should definitely choose Fatihs place. Im sure youll be surprised to see Turkey with his eyes! :)",5

Being a 20 minute walk away from the Blue Mosque meant that we were never disturbed by the early morning call to prayer - so many reviews mention how noisy it can be. The beds were comfortable and we slept well. Breakfast was more than adequate, in fact, everything exceeded our expectations for a hotel in this price bracket. Salih and his team are able to arrange anything and provided us with good advice and tips on what and what not to do. We were travelling with my elderly mother who has mobility issues but she managed the location without difficulty: turn left out of the hotel up the steep hill and keep climbing until you hit the street with trams OR turn right and walk to the mosque along mostly level roads then walk back up the tram road from the Blue Mosque and then down to the hotel - easy. And DO check out the newly opened Roman cistern  just up the hill. Discovered in 2010 it is smaller than the Cistern Basilica but equally impressive and the crowds havent discovered it yet; we were the only visitors to this vast underground space with towering columns.",4

(We had a car, so Im not sure how easily accessible it is without a car, but I assume its not too difficult.) By car its 15 minutes from the Ataturk airport (IST) so it made coming and going from there a cinch!

I also like the fact that we are provided with a small vacuum cleaner, so its a breeze cleaning up since its a small space. Thank you Sefa, we appreciate your hospitality",4

26669415,"Warning: photos are not real, room  is different. The only thing that is good in this place - it is really close to the main sights, about 10-15 minutes walk. 
But : 
small room has three single beds and a drawer in it, and one of the beds  is broken. 
AC is broken seems ages ago. It is really stiffed air there with a smell of old house  and room does not even have  a fan! Barely you can sleep well there. 
Hostess didnt bother to change linens. So we slept at dirty bed shits and pillows. Also there was definite lack of towels.
Bathroom is absolutely need a massive repair. Such amount of mildew I havent seen long time.

I ended up at Musas place because my previous host cancelled the booking while I was boarding my flight to Istanbul,  which happened to be the best part of this trip. 

Musa responded very quickly, and he even gave a discount. Throughout my stay Musa and Halim were very attentive and thoughtful. Not to forget their beautiful cat, Chizik! 

Though They are students but still their place is very clean and stylish. Very close to everything you need. Like literally everything. 

Transportation: Taksim Square/ Metro is 4-5 minutes walk away. The Tram (FINDIKLI Mimar Sinan University) is like 5 minutes by walk too.. Taxis are also available throughout the day and night near the main road.

A grocery store and fruit shop is right outside the home. And some food/Restaurant are available 24hours. They can actually get things delivered at anytime in the night too.. even their kitchen has all amenities for using.. 

To whom ever it may concern, If you are planning to go to Istanbul and If you are reading this, dont think twice. Contact Musa now. You will enjoy your stay. 

PS: They are learning English but communicating with them was so easy. They really make effort to make your stay comfortable. Just ask them if you need anything, theyll get it done.. And their kind intention is to make friends and learn about different cultures while they whole heartedly welcome you as their guests.. Enjoy!

Guys! ok ok teekkur ederim ! Take care and see you soon.. 

Cheers!

Nice enough flat for the price, and the pictures are quite accurate. However, also as seen in the pictures, theres no laptop friendly work space  even if its listed in the Amenities section.

We arrived to a cold flat after having some trouble finding it (the building doesnt have a street number), and heating it up took all evening  partially because theres a big gap under the flats entrance door, and the stairwell is open to the outside at all times. Which leads us to the next issue  stray cat feces and stains on the steps. It was cleaned now and then, but not nearly often enough.

The building is old and full of old house noises, from neighbors and the environment. While some of this can be charming, I would have expected other things to be in order, easy things like tightening a door bolt so that it doesnt rattle whenever someone downstairs breathes.

7427199,"Absolutely loved this place! This was my first ever visit to Istanbul and I rented the place for the whole month. The decor of the room is very clean and modern. Soft and comfy bed.  Felt like a hotel room with a lot of great natural light. Bathroom was fantastic as well, especially the shower. Super fast wifi. Helpful staff: there was one time I needed to make a reservation at a restaurant that only spoke Turkish, and they helped me with that. Location was very central, close to Taksim and Nisantasi where there are some great restaurants. Highly recommend!",5
7427199,"My previous reservation with another host was cancelled the same day I was to check-in. Fortunately, Emrah responded quickly to my requests, answered all my questions and even allowed me a quick tour of the facility. His staff helped me with my luggage, laundry and all of my requests for the duration of my stay. The apartments are new, clean, modern, and avante-gardesque. Angular shaped space, concrete walls with clean white walls, tasteful furniture to match. So many things are in walking distance, metro is close by, centrally located to many of the sites to see in Istanbul. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new, clean, hotel-serviced, apartment centrally located in Istanbul.",5
7427199,"Handsomely designed studio with a very nice bathroom and a separated eating/cooking area. Perfect for one or a couple. The location in Harbiye is very convenient, just one street from the main avenue. Emrah is a great host and the apartments are perfect for a short-term stay.",5
7427199,"The location was superb, easily accessible by metro and bus stops. Despite being on a lively main street, the accommodation was very quiet. The room service was excellent, clean and tidy. Employee Frau Derya was always friendly and approachable and always made an effort to fulfill all requests. The amenities were optimal, although there were occasional difficulties with the internet connection, which were quickly resolved.",4
